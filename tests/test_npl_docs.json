These loads have non-linear characteristics and cause harmonic distortion. Filtering is one of the common ways utilized to eliminate harmonics and compensate reactive power. Filters are categorized in three types: passive, active and hybrid. Both passive and active filters have their own deficiencies while hybrid filters benefit from advantages of both former filters while overcoming their deficiencies. In this paper, active, passive and hybrid filters are discussed and then a suitable hybrid structure is introduced. Thereupon a harmonic model of an intercity electric train is presented and application of the proposed hybrid filter structure to the train is simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of utilization of such hybrid filter structure in elimination of harmonic components and reactive power compensation.", "inCitations": ["697c7c9d2be907239f72d75b65b27ba1e2022dab"], "pdfUrls": [], "title": "Utilization of Hybrid Filter to Eliminate Harmonics of 25 kV AC Electric Railway", "doi": "", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 1978, "outCitations": [], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2642c4ab9ffbfff4f6c8ffda42ee61493984bc4d", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "2642c4ab9ffbfff4f6c8ffda42ee61493984bc4d", "authors": [{"name": "Richard L.

Given this background, under the chance constrained programming (CCP) framework, a new method is presented to handle these uncertainties in the optimal sitting and sizing problem of DGs. First, a mathematical model of CCP is developed with the minimization of DGs investment cost, operational cost and maintenance cost as well as the network loss cost as the objective, security limitations as constraints, the sitting and sizing of DGs as optimization variables. Then, a Monte Carolo simulation embedded genetic algorithm approach is developed to solve the developed CCP model.

Hydrated alumina is the principal reaction product. Estimates of the operating characteristics of the vehicle were made on the basis of laboratory test results, performance-simulation-model test results, and hypotheses on the refueling. The LLL performance simulation model provided input data to the analysis on component weights, total vehicle weight, and fuel efficiency by simulating the SAE 227a(D) driving cycle for a five-passenger vehicle with an assumed power-to-weight ratio of 50 W/kg (0.03 hp/lb) and a range of 1600 km. The results indicated that the total vehicle weight would be 1854 kg, including a passenger and cargo load of 136 kg, and that the vehicular fuel efficiency would be 51 g/km. Cost and energy parameters were estimated on the basis of existing technology and resource pricing structures. Then the results of theses status-quo assessments were considered in the light of potential changes in technology and resource prices. The net cost to the consumer for aset of recycled replacement anodes was found to be $90 to $100.

Each of the systems when viewed in isolation appears to be completely different to each of the others; however, we have found this not to be the case, in that common architectural challenges have emerged from each system. In this paper we review the issues we encountered on two early hybrid projects and discuss our experimental efforts at creating a unified control strategy framework for combining different components, in a way that provides a consistency of view between the individual subsystems and the system as a whole.

The flexibility enabled with hybridization creates chances for a synergistic approach, in which the hybrid supervisory control can be augmented to address both the emissions and the efficiency. In this paper, two policy optimization techniques are proposed, namely stochastic dynamic programming and neurodynamic programming, for designing power management controllers. These controllers are then compared with a baseline rule-based controller. The intention is to investigate the additional benefits possible through application of policy optimization algorithms and a systematic framework capable of representing complex system-level effects. The power management of a series hydraulic hybrid vehicle is pursued as a sequential decision-making problem under uncertainty (stochastic control). The low energy density of the hydraulic accumulator adds to the control challenge. First, stochastic dynamic programming and neurodynamic programming are applied to design a controller based on the fuel economy objective. The problem is subsequently expanded to include minimization of transient diesel engine emissions. This poses additional challenges due to the increased state space. The problem is computationally intractable by stochastic dynamic programming and is solved using the newly proposed neurodynamic programming framework. Finally, the supervisory controllers are implemented and evaluated using simulations and an engine-in-the-loop facility. It is shown that, by designing an intelligent multi-objective controller, significant reduction in both the fuel consumption and the emissions can be achieved compared with strategies which focus solely on the fuel consumption.", "inCitations": ["68bf71bb75c4d90ffe9ea13ed59ade110071048b", "7de73695a236306b8f182468fdc4e40f0e140d15", "0d4ed9b2e7eb50d28880531c64355d625eacb836", "cb01dc6b20fa85dcea0fd7eb8db516f73997f411", "c908d960d837f2e654deb2a57360311ae78f85ef", "ff034f1219aff9c72b1b53e0b8340f57eaa9bbb1", "50aa793a0f47c6eb543132b553fd8ad19b97c4ab", "d41e9c89757d240127b7a428962992f579593ac2", "762d6fc8610a4e7ed8e5628399aaf110e14a3e64", "c85c0925f985ece3223c863ae5560d4f17d56667", "ca1775ed2a37260833aa22a24993cabcfb0c2488", "e7330e7e7a1896532e4d8b12fe74f26016e176da", "aca7e1d54bc35051a2dbe2d33b10af0afefa7c41", "a0939d23e5c0380bd6958307d051c1a81527de7f", "06bcbcac6d8fceb461a7ca11f95e31ccefe10583", "4caa9946f706a506e56f03c8bf3dee5214c5d439", "8bb6b0769df5fe0ecb3a60a5c799475b84fb117e"], "pdfUrls": [], "title": "Optimal energy management of a series hybrid vehicle with combined fuel economy and low-emission objectives", "doi": "10.1177/0954407014522444", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1177/0954407014522444", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1-5", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "year": 2018, "outCitations": ["3d56a8b9967352c241122e2eba9e0421a8db2fa5", "5909e4cbaf67b6c48a3537f7e6a013dcaf14ddda", "9c6b87b6c616425dcb2d415da0bccbfba710acbc", "68602b6a782ffd2f93a2f274f5c0af9465b05a5d", "f9d13719648df01d1910f70bded49e69fcf37245", "e9f3e7559752cb3a8a0270c05a325fed65afc83f", "0ef6cd290d386535dc241079af34be261ed0cf07", "1f8850cb83dc9044ed107411434f6da0f58ee40d", "ce6184e3d24efeebe3822557096baf773898b0d9", "e331afb71f5cabbdc19f4ad90a072e38e7326bae", "fc94c35541ee5164d49122533f16cdc5648b000c", "90435ebf3f9734a88e16c5b7b0d4350607f61157", "e502e1cecc027cff505ddc1bb2e19d9d848136eb", "038c51298734bd15c048925dffd31560f1b45f06"], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9151d573451309617a87c6f961449bbe54c9804f", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "9151d573451309617a87c6f961449bbe54c9804f", "authors": [{"name": "Trapti Yadav", "ids": ["36036178"]}, {"name": "Deepti Yadav", "ids": ["2776196"]}], "journalName": "2018 5th IEEE Uttar Pradesh Section International Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering (UPCON)", "paperAbstract": "The most important power quality impact of electric vehicle and renewable generation are variability and uncertainty of renewable generation and this problem can be overcome by using the integration of Electric-Vehicles (EVs) and Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) into the electric power system.

A typical efficient energy conversion system for point absorbers is based on hydraulic power take-off (PTO) systems, consisting in a double-acting cylinder, a hydraulic motor and two or more accumulators. This paper presents a simple model of a heaving oscillating buoy extracting power by means of a hydraulic system. The hydrodynamic behaviour of the absorber is modelled through application of the linear water wave theory. Apart from the basic elements listed above, the model of the hydraulic system includes leakages and pressure losses and takes into account the compressibility of the fluid. Also, possible control accumulators are considered in order to improve the performance of the hydraulic system by means of properly controlled valves. Different control variables are analysed depending on the wave inputs considered in order to improve the power extraction of the converter. The results prove that it is possible to achieve a great enhancement of the power extraction with the implementation of these control strategies and that a possible combination of some of them might be beneficial for improved efficiency of the components.", "inCitations": ["bf829e889ddffaa8b3701ea806183c0bbd44326e", "0201a47a59fb8497f319444be6a9d17326fa9d96", "f61939c0c72b5176926d6e756492b4eb0cf5a29e", "c026c59c3beaf99e3799b8e3d2945a57d69d3fb7", "22bffbd6f359721b0683ded10d8edf18b55c4017", "fa9fd160d69a5887af0b8d6a39b8a62108d440dc", "e2182cb36387dde721f1ed0e7f7384649929d54f", "a86d658d1aef476e9e611b07d268ca2fa7f27671", "f90a3783eeb2e26a673c2a0dea8a5f2913abf925", "14f86ed2a29ea85d19c55e32696b5d41c6f3d536", "e67f9778b2c62d1184fec027fb40b387f8ea0cc4", "dd5b7165d6d04700bda271007037af71e09ce21b", "319f4493f2d1d3b05c84c5869dec78b79e39f451", "0f8c6d03d3bdd1e6597a73ebd6a4f9e0e8602927"], "pdfUrls": [], "title": "Control strategies for a wave energy converter connected to a hydraulic power take-off", "doi": "10.1049/iet-rpg.2009.0197", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1049/iet-rpg.2009.0197", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 2013, "outCitations": [], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8dcc821959fe4cb41ba4f8af6c7f03ceea8b46c3", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "8dcc821959fe4cb41ba4f8af6c7f03ceea8b46c3", "authors": [{"name": "M.

A follow-up to Paths of Heaven: The Evolution of Airpower Theory, edited by Phillip S. Meilinger (Maxwell AFB, Ala.: Air University Press, 1997), Beyond the Paths of Heaven attempts to shift thinking away from a historical merger effected in the early 1950s. The authors simply do not believe that the two should be married in a sort of aerospace vehicle like an X-wing fighter. Instead, they should be kept separate but equal\u2014as should their doctrines. In a useful introduction, noteworthy for its honesty about the strengths and shortcomings of the contributors, Bruce DeBlois situates this volume within a new set of concepts about doctrine. Historians of technology will find two of the essays especially useful. Frank Gallegos\u2019s \u201cAfter the Gulf War: Balancing Space Power\u2019s Development\u201d contends that that 1991 conflict, said to be the first \u201cspace war,\u201d was anything but. Rather, the United States entered the war with a space power doctrine left over from the cold war, bent on a strategic and not a tactical view of the battlefield. At issue is Gallegos\u2019s belief that \u201ca lack of space power doctrine and experience caused the majority of the space-related problems in the Gulf War\u201d (p. 66), a lack that still endures. He provides summaries of the efforts at postwar lessons-learned in an effort to show that cold war security requirements established a pattern of U.S. space-system and doctrinal development difficult to overcome. More significantly, he advocates the establishment of \u201ca single military space sector,\u201d particularly through \u201cthe integration of all military and intelligence space activities\u201d (p. 90). This does not sit well with members of the space community who are still locked in the cold war mind-set. In David Ziegler\u2019s \u201cSafe Heavens: Military Strategy and Space Sanctuary Thought\u201d one can follow the historical development of policies that resulted in limiting U.S. space missions to surveillance, reconnaissance, intelligence, and communications.

Capturing variable renewable power requires the use of energy storage to shift generation and load demand. The integration of plug-in electric vehicles, however, impacts the load demand profile and therefore the capacity of energy storage required to meet renewable utilization targets. This study examines how the intelligence of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) integration impacts the required capacity of energy storage systems to meet renewable utilization targets for a large-scale energy system, using California as an example for meeting a 50% and 80% renewable portfolio standard (RPS) in 2030 and 2050. For an 80% RPS in 2050, immediate charging of PEVs requires the installation of an aggregate energy storage system with a power capacity of 60% of the installed renewable capacity and an energy capacity of 2.3% of annual renewable generation. With smart charging of PEVs, required power capacity drops to 16% and required energy capacity drops to 0.6%, and with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging, non-vehicle energy storage systems are no longer required. Overall, this study highlights the importance of intelligent PEV charging for minimizing the scale of infrastructure required to meet renewable utilization targets.", "inCitations": ["1679bb9852525934ed87278a53a2522ef20f7221", "25bd84fbde1e15340b4390a55a23db3776997662", "885985a722ab8428e8abfebd45ccaaba8da8ac7a", "35d605eb0d32a6761c0e1156507a553673071bc2", "317df377b582e334416e446e0245ac4511c7c4d6", "23c0213e8ab16a4677185d5fbf14df98f9921bde", "9a0ae284c2cb57a22278dedecfe3f995de1b8a69", "596c49ed80d9fe768cda5e3060ed97b6de49f6d9"], "pdfUrls": [], "title": "Charging a renewable future: The impact of electric vehicle charging intelligence on energy storage requirements to meet renewable portfolio standards", "doi": "10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.10.048", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.10.048", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 2017, "outCitations": [], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/aa34373c911a869d01f6686e7040048cc200d836", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "aa34373c911a869d01f6686e7040048cc200d836", "authors": [{"name": "Danielle Pr\u00e9vot", "ids": ["8350806"]}, {"name": "Yannick Borthomieu", "ids": ["96856500"]}, {"name": "Francesc Malet", "ids": ["32421833"]}, {"name": "Cl\u00e9ment Rebuffel", "ids": ["88764446"]}, {"name": "Aur\u00e9lien Carr\u00e9", "ids": ["101685100"]}, {"name": "C\u00e9line C\u00e9nac-Morth\u00e9", "ids": ["1403352508"]}], "journalName": "", "paperAbstract": "Today, the full electric propulsion is becoming more commonly used on board geostationary satellites for the launch up to the Electrical Orbit Raising (EOR) and all on-orbit manoeuvres.This electrical propulsion induces additional cycles for the battery that may result in higher ageing.The Electrical Orbit Raising (EOR) is currently simulated by two additional GEO seasons up to 80%DoD while the Plasmic Propulsion System (PPS) cycles are carried out, at least 162 cycles up to 24%DoD or 198 cycles up to 20%DoD per solstice season and at least 52 cycles up to 15%DoD or 64 cycles up to 10%DoD per eclipse season for 15 years.The need for an appropriate demonstration by life-test was anticipated and addressed in collaboration with the primes and the agencies, in the frame of ARTES 3\u20134 contract with ESA for the VES180SA cell & CNES contract for the VES16 cell.The article will present the whole cycling results available, and will provide afterwards the correlation status of Saft Li-ion Model (SLIM) with the experimental data acquired.", "inCitations": ["a9847e33a99e849e6a5c80ded57526860cd4db46"], "pdfUrls": ["https://www.e3s-conferences.org/articles/e3sconf/pdf/2017/04/e3sconf_espc2017_17005.pdf"], "title": "Saft Solutions For Full Geo Electric Propulsion", "doi": "10.1051/e3sconf/20171617005", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf%2F20171617005", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 2014, "outCitations": [], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/245946b37ab533fa1c4dac8365b3c4337f3f83ee", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "245946b37ab533fa1c4dac8365b3c4337f3f83ee", "authors": [{"name": "Sureshchandra Satapathy", "ids": ["68984903"]}], "journalName": "", "paperAbstract": "The aggravated increase in energy demand has posed a serious problem for the power system\u2019s stability and reliability, and hence has become of major concern.

This integration leads to a multitude of technical, economic and social challenges. Through a validated road-mapping process, the needs for future research, development, standardisation and regulation have been identified and visualised. Recommendations for action for decision-makers in politics and industry have been derived from those innovation needs. In summary, the most promising innovation path is the consequent application of smart and flexible charging concepts as well as an adaption of the regulations and roles in combination with the consequent usage of renewable energies. In five to ten years, also synergies through the exploitation of autonomous electric vehicles will gain momentum.", "inCitations": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/wevj/wevj-10-00076/article_deploy/wevj-10-00076.pdf"], "title": "Innovation Needs for the Integration of Electric Vehicles into the Energy System", "doi": "10.3390/wevj10040076", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.3390/wevj10040076", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 2005, "outCitations": [], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/04ace8daa5e610d1762c12a62a1c9a978d2f39f3", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "04ace8daa5e610d1762c12a62a1c9a978d2f39f3", "authors": [{"name": "Guo Jia-hu", "ids": ["1411426428"]}, {"name": "Wang Qing-ling", "ids": ["30628017"]}], "journalName": "", "paperAbstract": "Here the author describes detailed design of system which employs single-chip microcomputer to conduct digital magnet exciting device of synchromotor.

Its total production cost is very high not only due to inherent cost of fuel but also due to transportation and maintenance costs. Moreover, the use of fossil fuels is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Hybrid systems that combine wind turbines and diesel generators reduce fuel consumption, operational cost and pollution. Adding a storage element to this hybrid system increases the penetration level of renewable sources, i.e. the percentage of renewable energy in the overall production, and further improves fuel savings. Among all energy storage techniques, CAES (compressed air energy storage) has several advantages to be combined with hybrid WDS (wind-diesel systems), due to its low cost, high power density and reliability. In a previous work, we have exposed and have evaluated a new technique to transform the existing Diesel engine to a HPCE (hybrid pneumatic combustion engine), able to operate as a bi-source engine (compressed air and fuel). Based on ideal cycle modeling, we provided a first estimation of the annual fuel economy obtained with this multi-hybrid system (WDS\u2013HPCE). As a continuity to this work, we will compare, in this article, several strategies of management of the CAES. We will demonstrate that one of these strategies that uses an algorithm based on wind speed forecast, is the most efficient.

Pure electric vehicles require bulky, heavy, and expensive battery packs to enable an acceptable driveable range to be achieved. Extended-range electric vehicles (E-REVs) partly overcome the limitations of current battery technology by having an onboard fuel converter that converts a liquid fuel, such as gasoline, into electrical energy whilst the vehicle is driving. Thus enabling the traction battery storage capacity to be reduced, whilst still maintaining an acceptable vehicle range. This paper presents results from a drive style analysis toolset that enable US and EU fleet vehicle drive data to be categorised and compared. Key metrics, such as idle frequency, idle duration, vehicle speed, and vehicle acceleration are analysed. Vehicle usage patterns in the US and EU have been compared against each other and to relevant legislative drive cycles. Based on results from examination of the fleet data, a drive-cycle is selected and used as the basis for analysis of the fuel converter requirements for a hypothetical E-REV based on a typical European C-class vehicle. The influence of drive-cycle and battery pack size on the fuel converter requirement is discussed. Finally, the influence of the fuel converter efficiency upon the new European Drive Cycle (NEDC) fuel consumption of the E-REV is assessed.", "inCitations": ["843365061742a0e904d34e11d3f2729302d9724c", "094bfda713245b8eeb6aedce320a01a75a66ea90"], "pdfUrls": ["https://www.mahle-powertrain.com/media/mahle-powertrain/news-and-press/conference-papers/2010/2010_01_0832.pdf"], "title": "A Study of Fuel Converter Requirements for an Extended-Range Electric Vehicle", "doi": "10.4271/2010-01-0832", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.4271/2010-01-0832", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 2015, "outCitations": ["5ac936737894faf042d7d004f66f78bbb78763e1", "bfa6bf5e389e0f86f7da7d70627a404dacf9e9e8", "1f90357db05550d14c0508a5de112a04273bb3b7", "8e429330982b9015f15e5ddf695c1caf3bfcff5b", "c87e86c42959ed1879f85e8f78c715aaf78b7e23", "58b1f7994cf3b71f86e187afe939b93d7b4b1474", "bddce9d0d0e409b7223fd64fa3534688ea2410ca", "70e85dbfedeb4ae5c130cafc502340b2ae512519", "8a24ca0d6cb0d2a06ab227b4de0431e4eb1c3142", "385931f0856a3a33ea3449a8aaaf1bb5ce9ab4a7", "49b4009bbd35f9472899bec38ad21417be3924b7", "96efb09081cd748867968037bad38fb4b7b27835"], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cfb3aa91cb4b0358c73bb2690629663c0947411a", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "cfb3aa91cb4b0358c73bb2690629663c0947411a", "authors": [{"name": "Tobias Gustafsson", "ids": ["1932659"]}, {"name": "Anders Johansson", "ids": ["144373936"]}], "journalName": "", "paperAbstract": "Increasing the share of renewable energy used in the transport sector is seen as an important step to globally reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

In order to mitigate these issues, optimal placement and sizing of multiple passive filters for medium and low voltage network are determined using proposed modified lightning search algorithm (MLSA). Weight summation approach is used to identify the best location for the filter in the design stage, while Pareto with the assistance of fuzzy technique is used to determine a suitable sizing for the passive filter switching that will operate 24 hours a day based on EV consumer behavior. In addition, the proposed method also considers fast charging station (CS) and slow CS analysis for medium and low voltages, respectively. All power system harmonic flow, load profile, EV charging pattern, passive filter, CS and battery modelling are programmed in MATLAB. The performance of MLSA is compared with other metaheuristic techniques, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), firefly algorithm (FA) and lightning search algorithm (LSA). From the results, the MLSA is able to minimize the apparent losses and harmonic distortion at 33 bus radial distribution system (medium voltage) by considering worst harmonic distortion scenario from all 17 units of fast CS. The MLSA has provided superior result compared to PSO, FA, and LSA. Next, the proposed method was tested at 449 bus radial distribution system (medium and low voltage) with variance load and EV charging pattern for 24 hours, with fifteen minutes interval, using slow CS. The analysis shows that the optimal placements and sizes of variable passive filters were able to reduce the maximum total harmonic distortion (THD) for voltage, current and also the total apparent losses up to 39.14%, 52.5%, and 2.96 %, respectively. Furthermore, the results prove that the variation of passive filter is able to provide superior solution compared to single sizing. Therefore, it can be concluded that the multiple passive filters with an assistance of the MLSA algorithm is suitable to be implemented in minimizing overall apparent losses and harmonic distortions. This study is very useful as a guide for distribution network owners to control the impact of large-scale CS deployment in the future distribution system.", "inCitations": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://eprints.utm.my/id/eprint/81652/1/SyedNorazizulSyedPSKE2019.pdf"], "title": "Power loss and harmonic minimizanon at distribution system with electric vehicle by passive filter using modified lightning search algorithm", "doi": "", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1-6", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 2016, "outCitations": ["3d5bff019037a25c6c98c5d62942c627e7f696d7", "b2e4989b187f60a7fdf69b73ac9110be34693f9d", "c3b837c6fe3287df01fa0aa311821281839cc86c", "a68ca97ae4e8a1c1a484a37fce34d6fbff62555c", "532d023d37a5d7f255f854e054e6523d4af480b4", "5f16c460bb251c0d921a897a1c971f0cf040ffc7", "eb6ab6594d0189fae3ec9538b0e71dba1dfb0809", "b356d5c8b83317f91e8ee551e13890180804ceca", "1abfd32a08ebd27724e6563e0243b7de36f9e8d5"], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8c78c45bc92d8d2ef8582a75813dde39c064345e", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "8c78c45bc92d8d2ef8582a75813dde39c064345e", "authors": [{"name": "Goran Ga\u0161parovi\u0107", "ids": ["46418198"]}, {"name": "Branko Klarin", "ids": ["37356395"]}], "journalName": "2016 International Multidisciplinary Conference on Computer and Energy Science (SpliTech)", "paperAbstract": "The research presents results of analysis of 36 ferry and passenger routes on the Croatian Adriatic shore, with sail time up to 60 minutes. 19 of the routes representing 41.5% of daily mileage in the high season have been found suitable.

For achieving this goal, the role of integrated energy and urban mobility systems are explored as part of a city\u2019s strategy towards sustainability (2011\u20132020). For developing future scenarios, we used best practice foresight analysis methods, where the desirable future relates to European policy goals. In this research, we adapt the extended metabolism model of a city developed by Newman (1999) and the material and energy flow accounting by Sheerin (2002) to assess the future role of electric vehicles, renewable energy (RE) use for mobility needs and energy efficiency increases for house holds living in the city of Aveiro, a medium-sized city of 78,450 inhabitants in Portugal. The social costs of carbon related to alternative vehicle technologies (electric vehicles) are assessed, along with the integration of RE. Several energy sources were considered: hydric, wind, solar (thermic and photovoltaic) and solid waste (incineration and biogas). A Life-Cycle Assessment analysis was performed for this estimation, where a share of 56% of RE was assumed to be achieved until 2020. It was found that each battery electric vehicle and the use of RE has an external cost associated with climate change of 0.032 \u20ac/1000 pkm in 2011 and 0.012 \u20ac/1000 pkm in 2020.

I. Introduction MPROVEMENTS in electric power generation and storage technology, driven largely by demand in the automotive and portable computing (laptop) industries, are leading to growing interest in electric and hybridelectric aircraft propulsion. These improvements are enabling incremental advances in electric aircraft propulsion, from experimental demonstrations in niche applications towards practical use in mainstream applications. This is evidenced by the fact that there are now production electric-powered manned aircraft available (e.g. Antares 20E Sailplane, Lange Aviation), with still more planned for production. The practical applications for electric and hybrid aircraft are presently restricted to remote control hobby aircraft, small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), sailplanes, motorgliders, and light experimental airplanes. These applications have modest energy and power requirements (in the Watt to Kilowatt range) and are comparatively insensitive to propulsion system weight and volume. These characteristics make the above applications conducive to using today\u2019s battery, electric motor, and fuel cell technology as a means of propulsion. In contrast, typical commercial aviation applications require much more energy and higher power output levels (in the Megawatt range) and are more sensitive to weight. Gas turbines powered by Jet-A fuel far outstrip the energy/weight and power/weight capabilities of electric storage and power in this arena. However, the pace of advancement in electric power and storage technology appears to be outpacing advances in gas turbine technology. If this trend continues over a span of decades, it is reasonable to expect that electric motor, battery, and fuel cell technology will at length become practical for commercial aviation. It is therefore worthwhile to examine electric and fuel cell propulsion concepts in the context of commercial propulsion applications in order to ascertain what might be possible in the future as well as to identify what barriers must be overcome. The focus of this paper is on commercial transport aircraft targeted for a 2035 entry into service (EIS). There are many possible configurations one might consider for a hybrid electric propulsion system. This paper focuses only on gas turbine-fuel cell hybrid propulsion systems, to the exclusion of other possible arrangements. This was done to limit the scope of this paper and with full recognition that there may be other hybrid concepts worth studying.", "inCitations": ["c2be2ce9d8cc2aa0839197ed4311a253b5001b74", "8519296ea85bd1c851186715522bfa80959a1611", "40c9529fe0c1772b28a24e672299d2219d5d52c6"], "pdfUrls": [], "title": "Fuel Cell Hybrid Propulsion Challenges and Opportunities for Commercial Aviation", "doi": "10.2514/6.2010-6537", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2010-6537", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 1980, "outCitations": [], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/636e0f2628ed66e9d5f2bb3b16ecc18aef8e0bfc", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "636e0f2628ed66e9d5f2bb3b16ecc18aef8e0bfc", "authors": [{"name": "John B.

The solution is particularly suitable for remote areas where the cost of energy is very high not only because of inherent cost of technology but also due to transportation costs. It has significant environmental benefits as the use of fossil fuels for electricity generation is a significant source of GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions. The use of hybrid systems that combine renewable sources, especially wind, and Diesel generators, reduces fuel consumption and operation cost and has environmental benefits. Adding a storage element to the hybrid system increases the penetration level of the renewable sources, that is the percentage of renewable energy in the overall production, and further improves fuel savings. In a previous work, we demonstrated that CAES (Compressed Air Energy Storage) has numerous advantages for hybrid wind-diesel systems due to its low cost, high power density and reliability.

One of the most viable options identified was the use of a Stirling engine. As part of the military specification was the use of a liquid hydrocarbon fuel it was necessary to explore ways in which the necessary oxidant could be provided, using a commercial product, if possible. In the latter case the use of oxygen candles was identified as a viable option.

The device captures the wave power by buoy's heaving motion, transfers it by hydraulic system, and converts it into the electric power by generator. Power Take-Off (PTO) of the device is related to the resistance of the hydraulic system. However, effects of the hydraulic damping on the motion of buoy are often neglected and the study on the optimal hydraulic system is rare. In this paper, a new theoretical analysis has been developed, which is more applicable to the buoy considering hydraulic system. The paper establishes the governing equation considering buoyancy, wave dynamic force and hydraulic damping. The displacement and the velocity of the buoy are both obtained. The time-averaged power captured is calculated by integrating the square-velocity expression derived, and the existence of the maximum PTO is proved.

The system treated consists of a coal-fired power station, a temperature-swing absorption CO2 capture facility powered by a natural gas combustion turbine, and wind generation. System components are represented in a modular fashion using energy and mass balances. Optimization is applied to determine hourly system dispatch to maximize operating profit given energy prices and wind generation data. A CO2 emission constraint, modeled after a California law, is enforced. Idealized and realistic scenarios are considered, along with several different system specifications. For a year of operation, simulated using available wind and energy price data, operating profit for optimized operation is shown to be approximately 20% greater than profit using a heuristic procedure. The benefit from optimization is positively correlated with electricity price variability and mean wind generation. The impact of different component specifications and different CO2 absorption solvents on the optimal operation of the energy system is also assessed. In total, this study demonstrates that the effective operating cost of an integrated energy system operating under a CO2 emission constraint can be substantially reduced via optimal flexible operation.", "inCitations": ["2fbc363cf85d45c5bfaccf263f3e71733b6743c3", "935646031c7877f1ae33b4949753970f39e745a1", "12e50b38b27f9cf2c210d821ae48dc6433233ac4", "d11a03fd0b6bba36e672df9377c8a697d5109de3", "d6f53d10865fcff71a613e2d7b764b941a84ad94", "3d5fcb0392d8d2838a3f8dc77a94ebac365ab447", "2db4a4d6f904587f7f4d4533a54402854632b327", "1394a728f94dc1c214abb38c9f97dd5f4341252a", "9c1031699962dab6978eb2ce460a632d46676f23", "8b1843b5a276ad2233e93eade33ad005a818310c", "2d57a30b8ab1b4414549e1d85cea67c7cf541e7d", "632d145ad67994b6d6a92e054f3b6a2b5d64d7d1", "626b4356e59dcd85f00ae59eac2a7f3fcef76549", "ac1551ef10a396bc0c1ea952164b0f592da65064", "1336ec2d6cd997857c4719547d79a93e78846aeb", "382b8dcd2d75767bdbb53ad7c704b77912398623", "e6b78503adcafa924cfcbe5c501feba7b31b2b5b", "3176c6c40549d219b683f953d6ddb0f660943a1c", "d4a9a9cb0da514c88999afae84eeea8ad2097706", "9bfa1174b91ff4a733dfbc8f58638e21a9c58f23", "1d40515b130e076edeb8386f630b808f420d6d08", "aa106338f4c2c8929b90108a4d3e9008d333c22a"], "pdfUrls": [], "title": "Optimal operation of an integrated energy system including fossil fuel power generation, CO2 capture and wind", "doi": "10.1016/j.energy.2011.10.015", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2011.10.015", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 2016, "outCitations": ["aeee050b0b22f1a4d01aaeb3ba667575127bbd46", "7100f54afd08c76f65f1735120e2d7bc7abdebbb", "c00f43cca3e45fc51a5e4b61b788431d0765a506", "6c6e7924aee2963aa1ced454b560e2bf3ff88594", "528b70fc9666f87bd3fb0e1cb72d061e9101f380", "99e0c6f23b97be9bbfe8ea00140eb6c15f5fea79", "b4e1939f84b053f1253ca8dd0d7ac27bca9d9b88", "db8aab14273921c99600244d6ab372dbfa3f1810", "1649b5c24745499dee755dad909d7fedb11bd247", "139ecd84f9fb4bd74b08ff0f3e795beef6c1434e", "e872473265f7f0122c64f5cbf8bdbffb115b3528", "5309e59adbc7e92f4da7c47808301081933b2596", "9f1427679d6d0d751aa8ae5d862bb0419160010b", "e06d26d9ec087de56b5e7625fc71f013fb30898a", "9e9be6ff40efb75cfdd3eaec28033bba4b297f2f", "802658cf2813d1ba1fffc8ac7170207a2b2f67a4", "e0a6acb2aec99cf4ef9eec88faed14b60b962425", "174a0d46c92abefa8a7eba23eb6008255810e8f4", "681b104148f4be04b21ce71196ec2bc0a31d6755", "219b3a115c2d7a48cfb0679bcdbc2a437a6efdf4", "9ae22e9ebdd364c39bae09209f33f5343c2c95c1", "ac085e597357852740ff9285149c848a84b94c54", "be9598aa39e3694beff47199c5d771237bc1ba27", "02c65f364197ee42e2e6c3dd9e04d56763501eb8"], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b3ec9ebca6da059154a40aa47c1f55f96c5442bf", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "b3ec9ebca6da059154a40aa47c1f55f96c5442bf", "authors": [{"name": "Li Zhai", "ids": ["144700003"]}, {"name": "Xinyu Newman Zhang", "ids": ["49470392"]}, {"name": "Natalia Grigoryevna Bondarenko", "ids": ["144805974"]}, {"name": "David Loken", "ids": ["30959006"]}, {"name": "Thomas W.

The electromagnetic interference (EMI) filters, ferrite chokes, and shielding added in the product process based on the \u201cblack box\u201d approach can reduce the emission levels in a specific frequency range. However, these countermeasures may also introduce an unexpected increase in EMI noises in other frequency ranges due to added capacitances and inductances in filters resonating with elements of the power inverter, and even increase the weight and dimension of the power inverter system in EVs with limited space. In order to predict the interaction between the mitigation techniques and power inverter geometry, an accurate model of the system is needed. A power inverter system was modeled based on series of two-port network measurements to study the impact of EMI generated by power devices on radiated emission of AC cables. Parallel resonances within the circuit can cause peaks in the S21 (transmission coefficient between the phase-node-to-chassis voltage and the center-conductor-to-shield voltage of the AC cable connecting to the motor) and Z11 (input impedance at Port 1 between the Insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) phase node and chassis) at those resonance frequencies and result in enlarged noise voltage peaks at Port 1. The magnitude of S21 between two ports was reduced to decrease the amount of energy coupled from the noise source between the phase node and chassis to the end of the AC cable by lowering the corresponding quality factor. The equivalent circuits were built by analyzing current-following paths at three critical resonance frequencies. Interference voltage peaks can be suppressed by mitigating the resonances. The capacitances and inductances generating the parallel resonances and responsible elements were determined by the calculation through the equivalent circuits. A combination of mitigation strategies including adding common-mode (CM) ferrite chokes through the Y-caps and the AC bus bar was designed to mitigate the resonances at 6 MHz, 11 MHz, and 26 MHz related to the CM conducted emission by IGBT switching and the radiated emission of the AC cable. The values of Z11 decreased respectively by 15 dB at 6 MHz, 0.4 dB at 11 MHz, and 11.5 dB at 26 MHz and the values of S21 decreased respectively by 8.6 dB at 6 MHz, 7 dB at 11 MHz, and 6.3 dB at 26 MHz. An equivalent model of the power inverter system for real-time simulation in time domain was built to validate the mitigation strategy in simulation software PSPICE.", "inCitations": ["9b86027de17151af4c3df5979a6af3141b0f25bf", "ef386a5182394f848742b6064a227ae60fc2c7fc", "7d8f83ebb95dd409ef6a3eb55abe662db393a89e", "2c67ad37742a4fae5ebdcb60e4914f3b000e973a", "2251899a51ce0a165224902c93f71552f9cef6ed", "a0b752e35a275803e0e03d842ca6efd04c92a7e9"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/9/6/419/pdf"], "title": "Mitigation Emission Strategy Based on Resonances from a Power Inverter System in Electric Vehicles", "doi": "10.3390/en9060419", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.3390/en9060419", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 2003, "outCitations": [], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/37fc885df9a6e40d10007d0203c65e18a45b1220", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "37fc885df9a6e40d10007d0203c65e18a45b1220", "authors": [{"name": "Zeng Zhi-dong", "ids": ["1391369082"]}], "journalName": "", "paperAbstract": "A novel single-phase hybrid filter is proposed to compensate the harmonic current and the reactive power caused by AC-DC type of electric locomotive in power systems.

(A) ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: Novel vehicle technologies are imposing modified requirements to electrical storage systems. These technologies are electrical energy management as well as the various stages of powertrain hybridization. This paper characterizes the associated vehicle attributes. Changed requirements to the electrical storage system are derived, in particular: long cycle life, high dynamic charge acceptance particularly for regenerative braking, and robust service life in partial state of charge. The battery technologies under consideration (lead/acid battery with liquid or absorptive glass-fibre mat electrolyte, nickel/metal-hydride battery, lithium-ion battery, supercapacitor) are discussed with respect to their potentials for the various advanced applications. Aside from new cell technologies, growing importance is ascribed to the integration of the storage device into the controls of electrical system and powertrain. This requires, even for 12 Volt lead/acid batteries, complex but cost-optimized battery monitoring systems.

Hydrazine is a toxic, hazardous fuel which requires special safety equipment and processes for handling and loading. In recent years, there has been development of two green propellants that could enable their use in APU's: the Swedish LMP-103S and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) AF-M315E. While there has been work on development of these propellants for thruster applications (Prisma and Green Propulsion Infusion Mission, respectively), there has been less focus on the application to power units. Beginning in 2012, an effort was started by the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) on the APU application. The MSFC plan was to demonstrate green propellants with residual Space Shuttle hardware. The principal investigator was able to acquire a Solid Rocket Booster gas generator and an Orbiter APU. Since these test assets were limited in number, an Air Force equivalent asset was identified: the F-16 Emergency Power Unit (EPU). In June 2013, two EPU's were acquired from retired aircraft located at Davis Monthan Air Force Base. A gas generator from one of these EPU's was taken out of an assembly and configured for testing with a version of the USAF propellant with a higher water content (AF-M315EM) to reduce decomposition temperatures. Testing in November 2014 has shown that this green propellant is reactive with the Hydrazine catalyst (Shell 405) generating 300 psi of pressure with the existing F-16 EPU configuration.

Cooperating with business partners prevents duplicating efforts and allows a company to focus on its core competencies. Hence, collaborating companies together have the potential to form a strong supply chain. At the individual company level, practitioners of lean concepts have demonstrated dramatic improvements in productivity within their manufacturing facilities. However, the potential benefits of lean implementation are limited to four walls of companies when business partners are excluded from integrating into a leaner overall value stream. The flow from a lean supplier to a lean customer may not be lean if the two parties are not synchronized. As a result, the supply chain formed within lean companies may not be lean after all, due to lack of cooperation and synchronization among participating companies. Extending the value stream from a lean company to its partners allows the company to widen the pursuit for perfection to the whole supply network. Furthermore, applying lean concepts to a supply chain opens new windows of opportunity for supply chain participants to collectively achieve higher levels of competitiveness. Thus, the integration of supply chain management and lean thinking covers both local and overall leanness, which leads to a truly lean supply chain. This chapter provides an overview of the lean supply chain, the including concepts, approaches, challenges, and future development. In the first part of the chapter, basic concepts and impacts of lean thinking will be introduced, followed by the issues of applying lean thinking in supply chain management. Then, an integrated framework of a lean supply chain will be presented. The second part of the chapter covers the building blocks of lean supply chains, including lean logistics, information technology, performance measurement and improvement, and collaboration beyond partnerships. Subsequently, the challenges for building or maintaining a sustainable lean supply chain will be discussed. Finally, discussions of potential developments that can further improve lean supply chains will be summarized in the concluding section.", "inCitations": ["36fb5a54cf711c2855f87c0552463aaef1f3fd93", "4afed62f4ac738c7c0b6030b89a8661e91782680", "5ec4af1027cd7c1d89603854476db73d317c7619", "ea385dcc4ae4b573b9f414639be790efbb23a87f", "a79d21299cf62433efa5d79d24670d13e939d14a", "66acabc023e87fec49a54779eff460475ea13628", "efddda76060d26fb1fb2d0c34ab9d070348d9011", "1ceb62f00dd3f3d658d4a9683a026c5010594417", "aaec8ae44d728436482b59f612729105f2d7fb74", "cd2c80ddb454b0cd0287d457a75d43700c97bae6"], "pdfUrls": ["https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/978-1-84628-607-0_10"], "title": "Beyond Partnerships: The Power of Lean Supply Chains", "doi": "10.1007/978-1-84628-607-0_10", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-84628-607-0_10", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "IA-22", "journalPages": "495-501", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 1985, "outCitations": [], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e573ac2cd0ca934df0650a2b880ae8fb81bb754b", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "e573ac2cd0ca934df0650a2b880ae8fb81bb754b", "authors": [{"name": "Martin J.

As a result innovations, optimization, new concept design and simulation play a significant role in marine industry. Although 93% of the world\u2019s trade is done by ships and by the year 2011 the emissions of CO2 will contribute to 4% of world\u2019s CO2 emissions as well as 37% and 28% of NOx\u00ac and SOx emissions respectively, the marine sector is targeted. The problem of high emissions exists, when the engine operates in the non optimum condition, a percentage relevant to engine\u2019s MCR, tuned by the engine manufacturer. This means that in transient load (project SMOKERMEN, 2002; project HERCULES, 2007) large amounts of smoke, particle matter, NOx and SOx hazardous gasses are produced. Two stroke engines on board ships are directly coupled to the propeller using a rotating shaft. While ships operate in constantly changing environment and chartering commands change during voyage, propulsion unit have to adapt its speed and produced torque. Therefore engine loading changes to less efficient points and the SFOC is increased. Meanwhile, temperature of combustion and pressure differ from the most efficient and connected to them formulation of NOx increases along with increase in SOx, CO2\u00ac and smoke. Our work is based on real operational data provided by a Greek maritime corporation with a fleet of 65 cargo ships. The obtained data contains information from 3 Post Panamax new built sister vessels, regarding fuel consumption, engine loading, weather and sea conditions along with bunker characteristics (e.g. Sulphur percentage). Phase one of the project is separated into 3 parts. The first part includes worldwide adopted methods for emission calculation. Project utilizes the \u201cactivity based method\u201d (NTUA - Laboratory of Marine Transportations, 2008) which uses proper emission factors taken from relevant literature (VDMA Engines and Systems, 2008; MARPOL, 2005; EMEP/ CORINAIR, 2000). The second part, utilizes the voyage data of the vessels, correlates the consumption and engine loading with the weather characteristics. Furthermore, applies the assumption of constant loading of diesel engines and the existence of storage medium in order to estimate the fuel savings of the hybrid vessel. At the third part, industrial and market research was performed to find the proper storage medium. As first step, batteries were examined and different types were compared, judging by their energy density, weight, operational factors and restrictions. Also a proposal for sizing the alternative propulsion system was done and economical assessment was performed. Finally conclusions were discussed and they are summarized below: Hybrid Technology has significant fuel savings that can be increased due to further optimization of Turbochargers and by the operation of engine in smaller margin. Furthermore emission reduction in NOx is successful due to lower combustion temperatures. Moreover, ship design and cargo capacity will be affected making the overall task difficult. Finally, Hybrid Technology is economically feasible and the Internal Rate of Return of investment varies between 4.7% until 20.7% depending on the storage medium type and the availability of kWh.", "inCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "title": "Development of hybrid diesel - electric propulsion system for ships", "doi": "", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 2005, "outCitations": [], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/57b2aec39b13729645b0f4b0cdadf8ac1936627f", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "57b2aec39b13729645b0f4b0cdadf8ac1936627f", "authors": [{"name": "Li Huan-jia", "ids": ["1449307598"]}], "journalName": "", "paperAbstract": "The installation of the overweighed, oversized and ultra-high heat accumulator of the waste heat system for the 2\u00d7120 t converter at SISG is a difficult job.

The possible role of improved recharge availability in developing the BEV-PHEV market and the priorities that different charging options should receive from the government require better understanding. This study reviews the charging issue and conceptualizes it into three interactions between the charge network and the travel network. With travel data from 3,755 drivers in the National Household Travel Survey, this paper estimates the distribution among U.S. consumers of (a) PHEV fuel-saving benefits by different recharge availability improvements, (b) range anxiety by different BEV ranges, and (c) willingness to pay for workplace and public charging in addition to home recharging. With the Oak Ridge National Laboratory MA3T model, the impact of three recharge improvements is quantified by the resulting increase in BEV-...", "inCitations": ["bfc531a6caefd1173d393f6ec1ddf45334eb875a", "cf8e20bbccd8b3fd9e10d4112cbf6ccd6bef984e", "c79b2071b78bd98b6a938b6337226f7baa233e99", "b12d4a3233ccef1d3a3f6159af1ec05587de1371", "d0b6ae91c8f4e16a286b8fc332c1244172722bf1", "77fdf7c276396e5645508486f7408f6cb312c1d9", "a559134613fcaa0dce9129ee246ef3e37fbfa472", "bbc5ab63a7afcb7f19307ddb32b8022fcae835d2", "e63417c98eab2b6192644bf239005b8d48f02d17", "bb166fd0168154d453923797ca5c59b5f4bec2cf", "6359fe8e53cb11478dccbc9312cd66efe032a70f", "d64cebc51f179d64743d1316498939b334f4b80a", "14739099967ced0ee0d5fc104eaa9c099b226a5b", "f4fff8c3b4616218dd1e6335b656efb99413725a", "d5d05f172f3278a723229a1f2068bf064b8e4d82", "0ead57d3306ecbe5534fae15372af9ecd544662f", "04aac50e65474e9c16805c20660b9aec135e5276", "c5f66ede5c0c2381fe01cabfa1a29b50cd0c95e7", "5768ded32e164cdf435006ccccd59e1d717cd96d", "70121be03a5b408cad7274854614c1775b895747", "b7b9ba93ed5af0cc08786ad1f74777ba13e56f34", "7fbd7bc7f41a3f92e7774b7070bc3d9e00099487", "e23ee7f0a40742375e89a7486f8802ea1458d890", "05a28c12d66360496d0b1e3a4edcc2febdba1a42", "30d7c8cbb364a0ed21359d5b31a97e9ae97d0ba0", "2dfc1a6cb08fe1eb5a08f1a08fff5929b8e28943", "43f65120043cb6520d03269ad765323ae2b70670", "baa929e3cdf1b426e85daad41286e9ddf4fb05a8", "02e622fc2c9df0da06e2c3a5c94fd33ddd9b4abe", "d0de498bfdddd08707179cc4bc14874b5f6b667c", "0700e8f0a2f91de1d03294064ad6c5a83fd21f86", "b3664f61f76782e857235ab39ab969f4ea6590e1", "4f6383d197f0c7845efe062fbc6792d523c177cf", "c199be62e54745c384ae3c2d79569c5e7b660fac", "dddbe5a18cc40a8a1ecf512f26f9cccc4b4e50e0", "ada88dd8edeb8e1f9617dc8ae4f0e19cc690138c", "e2ab08aeb87744da899fc707a9f4c5eb74bf608d", "aa6eb1168d05227a218969407f3d449327c458ab", "c12b187b8ff383bdf19c1fac0611937b60f0cf6d", "6e0201e1f3bfcc5550bdcd0c703520b247034030", "6d02da8fa21a719388662a8ee5b94a5190602399", "a266a14cc9ebcfb2baf02b4edf5eb37fc199fa51", "2ad96f16167bd76a11a4619eafb8b929e1cf1936", "f7264165fb51684f5f9b4d3be786cb0ee0c49de8", "8b9af07c1f6cf9db71a4da2247fc62075d86132b", "e74703059127f4a77b6fc8f62d6d7c587d71f06f", "af0946dcfc50ebb34169f682378cb963a9017b02", "f63143ece888b8e9e598f89dba07299783c15abc", "639ad7a298149ce78a02342bc83584bdb1296228", "36663ac14b37e8f81c9cc4c500e2dc70294d90d7", "492d95815fdbeebc51a9a631e3b613ce717105ee"], "pdfUrls": [], "title": "Promoting the Market for Plug-In Hybrid and Battery Electric Vehicles: Role of Recharge Availability", "doi": "10.3141/2252-07", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.3141/2252-07", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 2010, "outCitations": [], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/55777ec5f2c956eaa50543c388f47b98b5079971", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "55777ec5f2c956eaa50543c388f47b98b5079971", "authors": [{"name": "Cheng Zhou", "ids": ["48622262"]}], "journalName": "", "paperAbstract": "In order to explore the performance of Atkinson cycle engines,Atkinson cycle was analyzed by using the existing speculative knowledge.Numerical simulation method was adopted to achieve Atkinson cycle through an engine model of Otto cycle on the AVL-Boost platform.The results indicate that the engine can obtain more thermal efficiency by using Atkinson cycle than Otto cycle.", "inCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "title": "Research On Atkinson Cycle Engines Used in Hybrid Vehicle Based on AVL-BOOST", "doi": "", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 1970, "outCitations": [], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7121a11683d795b56de15c182ab1de1b3a31e408", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "7121a11683d795b56de15c182ab1de1b3a31e408", "authors": [{"name": "Pin-chuan Chang", "ids": ["2077914"]}], "journalName": "", "paperAbstract": "Abstract : After reviewing the properties and limitations of chemical fuels such as gasoline, solid fuel and hydrogen fuel, the report discusses the possibilities of ionic fuel and nuclear fuel, and their existing problems of application to aviation.

By using C-LCL-filter based topology, better switching ripples attenuation is achieved, and the phase margin of the power stage at higher frequency is significantly improved. Adaptive linear neural network (ADALINE) is applied for individual harmonic component extraction and the estimated signals are used for selective harmonic elimination (SHE) purposes.

The project scope is to understand the generation of the vibration in PTO gearbox and provide recommendations to reduce vibrations. Modal analysis is a well established technique which defines the inherent properties of the structure. Modal analysis is used to measure the natural frequency and mode shape pattern. The analysis is done using both analytical and experimental methods. After analyzing the data from both methods, the resonance found for one of the component of gearbox. This creates the vibrations in the gearbox. FEA is done for this component with modifications to avoid the resonance. Prototype of the component is made as per modifications suggested and gearbox vibrations are tested. With modified component, the vibrations of the gearbox with separator engaged are reduced to within reasonable limits.

There has been an advent of the production BEVs in recent years; however their low range and high cost still remain the two important drawbacks. The battery is the element which strongly affects the cost and range of the BEV. The batteries offer either high specific power or high specific energy but not both. To provide the BEVs with the characteristic to compete with conventional vehicles it is beneficial to hybridize the energy storage combining a high energy battery with a high power source. This shields the battery from peak currents and improves its capacity and life. There are various devices which could qualify as a secondary storage system for the BEV such as high power battery, supercapacitor and high speed flywheel (FW). This paper aims to review a specific type of hybridisation of energy storage which combines batteries and high speed flywheels. The flywheel has been used as a secondary energy system in BEVs from the early 1970s when the oil crises triggered an interest in BEVs. Since the last decade the interest in flywheels has strengthened and their application in the kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) in Formula 1 has further bolstered the case for flywheels. With a number of automotive manufacturers getting involved in developing flywheels for road applications, the authors believe commercial flywheel based powertrains are likely to be seen in the near future. It is hence timely to produce a review of research and development in the area of flywheel assisted BEVs.", "inCitations": ["f37ebe17400b0ec1a75d355ddf5e054b70654534", "335bd2a4783720748c3f0692947910874f52fa64", "b20314d065e7f36e12ff84c7d3196170f051dddd", "02a66a88407b413a585e1fb20def92ed6a229679", "b1d310b4e1eb05c4cc3f61e65204f6e283ee87a2", "bc37abd70b815899ac3975bb499a64f9035067e9"], "pdfUrls": [], "title": "Review of battery electric vehicle propulsion systems incorporating flywheel energy storage", "doi": "10.1007/s12239-015-0051-0", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s12239-015-0051-0", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "year": 2015, "outCitations": [], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3cb5c4cf3f771b352b9f2077cce596c16762d098", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "3cb5c4cf3f771b352b9f2077cce596c16762d098", "authors": [{"name": "\u9ad8\u6d77\u6ce2", "ids": ["74393067"]}, {"name": "\u8a79\u8f72\u501a", "ids": ["101665348"]}], "journalName": "", "paperAbstract": "The invention discloses a diesel-electric hybrid power ship propulsion system and an energy management method of the diesel-electric hybrid power ship propulsion system.

There are three primary ways that natural gas could be used in personal vehicles: compressed natural gas (CNG) in a combustion engine, as a source of hydrogen for a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV), and to generate electricity for a battery electric vehicle (BEV). In this work, we compare these three paths by analyzing their current and theoretical maximum well-to-wheels (WTW) exergy efficiencies. Each pathway begins with the extraction of natural gas and ends with delivery of work to the vehicle\u2019s wheels. The best current and theoretical maximum well-to-wheels exergy efficiencies for CNG, FCEV, and BEV pathways are found to be 31%/63%, 25%/87% and 44%/84% respectively. The largest exergy destruction for the CNG pathway occurs within the vehicle\u2019s internal combustion engine (ICE) plant, which has a best current efficiency of 35%. For the FCEV pathway the main current sources of exergy destruction are the reforming stage and within the fuel cell engine plant, with best current efficiencies of 69% and 50% respectively. For the BEV pathway, the largest exergetic loss occurs during the conversion from natural gas to electricity at a combined cycle power plant, with a best current efficiency of 59%. While the theoretical maximum succeeds in identifying process steps that limit efficiency, it does not inform how much progress could be made to improve efficiency with what effort.", "inCitations": ["268f1a1341b66bfbc72e711d35926136116311ae", "c6bd36e01d0112d434ecb2036a230708dd8221a8", "30d7c8cbb364a0ed21359d5b31a97e9ae97d0ba0", "8b18e4d5f1d23eaf1a73ccd2ea7380dd09382efc", "23a8c5955abb15c4ac919251f29c0fc3b47d96a7", "38f0584d9fdd2d62fc4c92822ed6fc26e9aee086", "e582dd935dc01cdf531c0a95409b1d4edecedf20", "714c7cb0d08ec4b14886e2a53f85eea94f0afbb8", "a620761879f6c113fe31097569b0061841430914"], "pdfUrls": [], "title": "Current and theoretical maximum well-to-wheels exergy efficiency of options to power vehicles with natural gas", "doi": "10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.03.088", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.03.088", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 2004, "outCitations": [], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c071b0592a0ea9264b920e6ec15b590910074d0c", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "c071b0592a0ea9264b920e6ec15b590910074d0c", "authors": [{"name": "Menahem Anderman", "ids": ["91633268"]}], "journalName": "", "paperAbstract": "In this paper, we will analyze the power requirements of advanced vehicles and assess the likelihood of the top power-source contenders to meet those power requirements in the foreseeable future.", "inCitations": ["7dc66e889dac8e3510164ff84beaf59af2b76f54", "91f4e612f3109f20920970ee019dd478786ba141", "28fca25b6a127030ba201398bec1fd8dabdcdcd1", "a1cb1a74e6989f73eab4cbe0f8ca146fd17f4b7a", "092e3e924f9f35d54d1e062eafd172f4fbb2b648", "416df5750f02697d03660c3a1e9484a8419c4f51", "88d9ed51d8bf9c230052dcadad0b675588e46981", "123171c6c3cd271cfe769d5282cd8149513cad5f", "a63378a3ec21d0633e6537abd03ef591d08b3802", "e533eca45212e4c3cf080d6ae910761378e70727", "ceb45b49764660c8bc8051029a4dd75fb2056998", "fcfd1e2c01700fc7b267b2cfe91390c4d113e4e0", "c935989ee7749f5f98c4d5996a6df30741095364", "68a9fa39cf16a06ae7ea4d45c247d0c2ceffd312", "7541bc22c1acf14137bf27547277e83aee7494e4", "6cea89e6f429ba94f0429cafbba9254d7bc82611", "0cc874cd39a308ececc922208ca22ea7039c2972", "bf1446135e2be1aab39f8bc2fd9ebcdb7e35ce10", "f3727aea82e93b1e0c78da04489078ae769d565a", "9a75e8e23788e8f018a1e392911bd9f1a6345b18", "715181dc3443aa5fb9cc60c754e53b9fbfe34633", "b85ddb4e356d2dbff9c3081884523cd0c61f4e51", "2abe9d50507dcc1e9933ef207f0c3508c52bc297", "3a0ef486f3f16d1e79b748498a35ee3ad693d172", "300afec31ca95e0fa461b476fcac0cc0ccc2c739", "3ba7e52855cc1518ebd3db1b249695b5e59ac22c", "e8b9614742a36a7be958a6e307c9623fb876647b", "5c0ce6b3d95212eba7ca9aa3057b194e09fbc3a0", "1a63193dc5be2570bd054a0a25c18df00012d03e"], "pdfUrls": [], "title": "The challenge to fulfill electrical power requirements of advanced vehicles", "doi": "10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.09.002", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.09.002", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1293-1301", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "year": 2019, "outCitations": ["8263efcbc5e6b3c7c022b1131038b888babc8548", "54b1393054e0f210b82ed7ee60b54025cc8f8d15", "e8acf54e4a4d29bb15556b059587fa4802ab72da", "7642c71496286efe3e1ca97f75655fc7afa4efa8", "171dc06a73166396aed8ee267940a6e5a453c43a", "8f69e24a082577eff2e51a95131dd16f0575a4b2", "c5aca9f658c445902a12fdea4492108476b7854d", "aa67babb7362000237e7e4dd0068b0d80b36cdf6", "e4a2397ab4bb507ea5bedb2ad668fbb7813e5425", "c6fc6d5a80ad9ab42ed241f69e80d7199ca8174f", "7775dcba0d70f56688cd2f7c668731feea929497", "a479d8ce1edd9be14262ec1de403f7d11c70da06", "c7a7b65446dcb4b6b58e5cfe67c11e9b22ec8602"], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fe0973cbfee8b6fd69c91d93916f6d585f2b3167", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "fe0973cbfee8b6fd69c91d93916f6d585f2b3167", "authors": [{"name": "Mehdi Neshat", "ids": ["39289460"]}, {"name": "Bradley Alexander", "ids": ["145289858"]}, {"name": "Nataliia Y.

In this research, we investigate the problem of maximising the energy delivered by farms of wave energy converters (WEC's). We consider state-of-the-art fully submerged three-tether converters deployed in arrays. The goal of this work is to use heuristic search to optimise the power output of arrays in a size-constrained environment by configuring WEC locations and the power-take-off (PTO) settings for each WEC. Modelling the complex hydrodynamic interactions in wave farms is expensive, which constrains search to only a few thousand model evaluations. We explore a variety of heuristic approaches including cooperative and hybrid methods. The effectiveness of these approaches is assessed in two real wave scenarios (Sydney and Perth) with farms of two different scales. We find that a combination of symmetric local search with Nelder-Mead Simplex direct search combined with a back-tracking optimization strategy is able to outperform previously defined search techniques by up to 3%.", "inCitations": ["a0fdf30e9ed9ba85a0b69dc95f3cef37b95d49d4"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1145/3321707.3321806", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07043", "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07043v1.pdf"], "title": "A hybrid evolutionary algorithm framework for optimising power take off and placements of wave energy converters", "doi": "10.1145/3321707.3321806", "sources": ["DBLP"], "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3321707.3321806", "venue": "GECCO '19", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "2023-2029", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 2008, "outCitations": ["c31df299f6ad9505b94941acaa024dd04c4f00c8", "8cda2c5811f2af356e124f8aa8ae180a308a3be0", "2fd295abf137922e1f94ca78345e244dafe3b2cc", "5dbba6f3336e396e56ef2ea07e8e60e36b99db2f", "b90c8daa0baab23916c699694fa98c973739cd96", "f2719dbbb54b445dd08b1ccfdab7af5b20f7ad2b", "22955fd11c7f839b83490a79d768e4833db46442", "3253d16ac13b0e9f9261a1e6b7dbd3f62f86140b", "bc49f216cb68981930c393ae7ec9779acfd7101b", "64dfbbcd7a3866fb99707d0a75542ecb37e793dd", "4a89fd79e4bc0a65c9b6dc33b60bab0a7d775b17", "237a0486839bbcc8de0b2f3a88cb194b81f05a96", "ce07434e6dfb35586fcd1e05b078002bd1ccf480", "007043f17d08769b8f774829dcfcd67aec1d144a", "8be24692ef4d13c0f7bfc31b41a47ef75b6d5ec2"], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6318639726dc8e9b81dee8f743e18dae1d4fa7e2", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "6318639726dc8e9b81dee8f743e18dae1d4fa7e2", "authors": [{"name": "Longhui Wu", "ids": ["31405224"]}, {"name": "Fang Zhuo", "ids": ["1988845"]}, {"name": "Pengbo Zhang", "ids": ["33069327"]}, {"name": "Hui Li", "ids": ["47892286"]}, {"name": "Zhaoan Wang", "ids": ["3286239"]}], "journalName": "2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference", "paperAbstract": "When applying parallel active power filter (PAPF) to the power transmission/distribution system that contains the reactive power compensation capacitors, the capacitors can influence the system stability and the compensation performance of PAPF.

The analysis results show that, when capacitor current is not included in the detected load current, PAPF has ideal performance of load harmonics compensation and parallel resonance damping, but has no effect on damping series resonance and compensating harmonic current caused by supply voltage distortion; when capacitor current is included in the detected load current, PAPF with traditional control method can't work stable. To improve the system stability and the performance of PAPF, a novel control method of PAPF is proposed. With the proposed control method, PAPF has excellent performance for harmonics compensation and resonance damping.

A systematic method of choosing the gain parameter of the wind turbine generator pitch control by the second method of Lyapunov that guarantees stability is presented.

Hybrid-electric propulsion systems can take advantage of the synergy between two technologies by utilizing both internal combustion engines and electric motors together, each operating at their respective optimum conditions. However, there can also be disadvantages to hybrid propulsion. We are conducting an analysis of hybrid-electric propulsion for aircraft, which is looking at modelling systems over a range of aircraft scale, from small UAVs to inter-city airliners. To support the theoretical models, a mid-scale hybrid-electric propulsion system for a single-seat manned aircraft is being designed, built, and tested to generate data for validation and development of the simulation models. This paper draws parallels between the synergy of hybrid-electric propulsion for automotive and aviation applications, and presents an innovative theoretical approach integrating several desktop PC software packages to analyse and optimize hybrid-electric technology for aircraft. Our findings to date indicate that hybrid-electric propulsion can have a significant impact in the small- and mid-scale sectors, but only a minor impact in the large-scale sector assuming battery energy densities predicted for the next decade.

Steady-state initialization is important for the startup of an electromagnetic transient simulation. One of the commonly used steady-state analysis is phasor analysis. If the system is free from harmonics, phasor analysis is accurate. However, when a nonlinear or time-varying component is present in the system, phasor analysis is inadequate because the impact of the harmonics on the operating point is not taken into account. This paper presents a new power flow algorithm based on both time and frequency domains, which is also called the hybrid analysis. The proposed power flow algorithm employs a time-domain method to model nonlinear components and time-varying components and uses a frequency domain method to handle linear and distributed elements. Although in the past work, hybrid approach has been used to obtain steady-state voltage and current waveforms of a nonlinear or time-varying system, it has not yet been used for a power flow analysis. In this paper, we will show how to extend the existing hybrid method to account for the power flow constraints, imposed by the generator and load buses. Moreover, the proposed method is more efficient, as compared to the existing method because one redundant Newton iteration loop is eliminated in the proposed hybrid method.", "inCitations": ["0023d37d5b7b93ae34d6007301c07c679c204dc8", "d6e19c0421ca53a4d9ed42059812f9db691983e5", "e80739beb40a3367f430defa7cd5023a7e66c298"], "pdfUrls": ["http://ipstconf.org/papers/Proc_IPST2009/09IPST070.pdf"], "title": "A Three-Phase Harmonic Power Flow Algorithm Based on A Hybrid Approach", "doi": "", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 2008, "outCitations": [], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/462960a88ffdf144bccd3fa281bcabb5d95e303d", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "462960a88ffdf144bccd3fa281bcabb5d95e303d", "authors": [{"name": "Wang Zhao-an", "ids": ["9283215"]}], "journalName": "", "paperAbstract": "In power system, capacitors are widely used to compensate reactive power, which generally cause resonant problems in harmonic distorted network.

The analysis results show that PAPF is effective for parallel resonance damping, but can not damp series resonance when capacitor current is not included in the detecting current. And when capacitor current is included in the detecting current, PAPF is prone to be unstable and can not damp parallel and series resonance. Then a novel control method of PAPF is proposed. PAPF with the proposed control method has excellent performance in damping of both parallel resonance and series resonance, whether the capacitor current is included in the detecting current of PAPF or not.

One of the alternative that has already gained importance is electric vehicle. Research fraternity have already started working on development of fuel efficient hybrid electrical vehicles. The current generation of electrical vehicle runs on a battery that needs to be charged frequently in either charging stations or home before they can be used. The major components of any electric vehicles are battery technology, charger design, motor, steering, braking etc. One of the major disadvantage is that the power generation in electric vehicle is nil and hence the travelling distance shortens for these type of vehicles. This again is a cause of concern as electric as an energy is also reducing and causing global warming in general. This paper proposes a system for design of a power regeneration system for the electric vehicles.

Among the challenges due to existing regulations is the need for improved control of evaporative emissions from gasoline vehicles and emissions of particulate matter from heavy-duty diesel trucks. Potential future challenges could arise from the need to control refueling emissions and from more stringent emission standards for hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen. Virtually all of these regulations require technological changes to vehicles and engines, assuming that gasoline and diesel fuel remain as the operating fuels. However, recent speculation has centered on the possibility of meeting some or all of these regulatory challenges with alternative fuels such as natural gas or methanol. This study addresses that possibility by examining current and potential standards, characterizing vehicles that use alternative fuels, and assessing -- via an informal canvass of manufacturers -- the likelihood of meeting the regulations with both conventional and alternative fuels. A selective literature review compares emissions, energy use, and costs associated with both types of fuels. Finally, a plausible scenario of introducing methanol- fueled autos and light trucks by the early 1990s is defined as the basis for examining changes in emissionmore\u00a0\u00bb levels nationally. While the overall reduction -- from all transportation sources -- of reactive hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen due to these vehicles is less than 1% by 1997, the potential remains for greater levels of reduction within urbanized areas, especially if tax-based incentives and other measures are used to encourage the use of vehicles powered by alternative fuels. 68 refs., 2 figs., 23 tabs.\u00ab\u00a0less", "inCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "title": "Motor vehicles in the 1990s: Emerging environmental constraints on current fuels, and emissions and energy trade-offs related to nonpetroleum alternatives", "doi": "", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1-6", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "year": 2019, "outCitations": ["f5bd66cee50d9d34ea3f82f148f7602ab427d4f7", "a6ea64826ef793aa7b767d7e6b5b8f0428a66e66", "0726a1e7cc10206f35c09eb6f9f2b367f8eb0e21", "6953b644fd017e213b9070ae13d5ab40ae34c879", "53f6a17a2fa9974409824bcf9982a600dea17f98", "aafb74799218a8d429ead1658c0407d1f6d5be2d", "897630556bd4868dac0d69b6b3eb26c1173b9541", "51f7ef8283aa851bd95260fa934bec8b9c202993"], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b9729c90f27ac87d0d894cf31f8d0ee8ca8c7e73", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "b9729c90f27ac87d0d894cf31f8d0ee8ca8c7e73", "authors": [{"name": "Jiayi Hu", "ids": ["47756492"]}, {"name": "Ziyou Song", "ids": ["144379654"]}, {"name": "Jianqiu Li", "ids": []}, {"name": "Zunyan Hu", "ids": ["93561277"]}, {"name": "Liangfei Xu", "ids": ["2400720"]}, {"name": "Minggao Ouyang", "ids": ["93422087"]}], "journalName": "2019 IEEE Transportation Electrification Conference and Expo (ITEC)", "paperAbstract": "This paper presents a novel energy management strategy for a dual-engine system adopted in a series hybrid heavy-duty vehicle.

The former is achieved by having the vehicles drive close after one another. The latter can be achieved by either allowing the speed to vary and thereby avoid braking altogether, or by using the electric machine to brake and storing the kinetic energy of the vehicle as electric energy in the battery. The control strategy finds the optimal states: velocity, battery state of charge, travel time, gear and engine state. It also finds the optimal control signals: the force from the engine, electric machine and mechanical brakes as well as switching gear and changing engine state. To make it less computationally demanding the optimization formulation is divided into two layers. One that finds the optimal velocity, battery state of charge and travel time using convex optimization and one that finds the optimal gear and engine state using dynamic programming. The control strategy is then applied to several test cases to evaluate its performance and to compare the fuel consumption of different types and sizes of platoons.

In the 1950s, the concept of using supercritical \u201csteam\u201d to increase thermal efficiency of fossil-fired thermal power plants became an attractive option. Germany, USA, the former USSR, and some other countries extensively studied supercritical heat transfer during the 1950s till the 1980s. This research was primarily focused on bare circular tubes cooled with SuperCritical Water (SCW). However, some studies were performed with modeling fluids such as SC carbon dioxide and refrigerants instead of SCW. Currently, the use of supercritical \u201csteam\u201d in fossil-fired thermal power plants is the largest industrial application of fluids at supercritical pressures. Near the end of the 1950s and at the beginning of the 1960s, several studies were conducted to investigate a potential of using SCW as a coolant in nuclear reactors. However, these activities were abandoned for some time and regain momentum in 1990s. In support of development of SuperCritical Water-cooled nuclear-Reactor (SCWR) concepts, first experiments have been started in annular and various bundle-flow geometries. At the same time, more numerical and CFD studies have been performed in support of our limited knowledge on specifics of heat transfer at SC Pressures (SCPs) in various flow geometries. As the first step in this process, heat transfer to SCW in vertical bare tubes can be investigated as a conservative approach (in general, heat transfer in fuel bundles will be enhanced with various types of appendages, i.e., grids, end plates, spacers, bearing pads, fins, ribs, etc.). New experiments in 1990s\u20132000s were triggered by several reasons: 1) thermophysical properties of SCW have been updated from 1950s to 1970s, e.g., a peak in thermal conductivity in the critical/pseudocritical points was \u201cofficially\u201d introduced in 1990s; 2) experimental techniques have been improved; 3) in SCWRs various bundle flow geometries will be used instead of bare-tube geometry; and 4) in SC steam generators of thermal power plants larger diameter tubes/pipes (20\u201340\u202fmm) are used, however, in SCWRs hydraulic-equivalent diameters of proposed bundles will be within 5\u201312\u202fmm. A comparison of selected SCW heat-transfer correlations has shown that their results may differ from one to another by more than 200%. Based on these comparisons, it became evident that there is a need for a reliable, accurate and wide-range SCW heat-transfer correlation to be used. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to summarise in concise form the work performed concerning with the heat transfer at SCPs, based mainly on examples of water, carbon dioxide, and R-12.", "inCitations": ["d98bfd644685aa46829e975c9edb38d81ac434fc"], "pdfUrls": [], "title": "Current status of research on heat transfer in forced convection of fluids at supercritical pressures", "doi": "10.1016/j.nucengdes.2019.110207", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nucengdes.2019.110207", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 2013, "outCitations": ["73286562b941428598a8123289f6eb40bad41e85", "bddd59ffdc0fe1e5005b0587e5afb88c9595475b"], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1e600ef4398dd7038ea54995f3bbdcb95fa75f72", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "1e600ef4398dd7038ea54995f3bbdcb95fa75f72", "authors": [{"name": "D.

The result is that most of the time the internal combustion engine works in regimes that are far from optimum mode. It means that specific fuel consumption is high. Some examples of measured operational regimes of locomotives in shunting operation and other motive power units are given in the paper. Kinetic energy of a classic diesel locomotive as well as the DMUs and trains is transformed into thermal energy during braking process. Normally it is not possible to utilize this kinetic energy in a reasonable way. In order to improve fuel economy, the kinetic energy of train should be transformed into a suitable form and stored for subsequent use. The improvement can be achieved by using of the unconventional traction drive of rail vehicles. One of possible ways is using of the hybrid traction drive. The hybrid drive includes the ICE, generator, traction motors and the energy storage device. In this case the output of ICE can be substantially lower than in the classic traction. The parameters of such traction drive must be based on analysis of real operational regimes of vehicles. There are other ways how to save fuel on railway vehicles, e.g. by better utilization of heat released from the fuel or using of solar energy.", "inCitations": ["e1c5f0837800f5f083d92fc85a2c5ffbfea8c783", "7ba29cde942896ca33a1fa5d975b0dbdf7fc85ef"], "pdfUrls": ["https://www.wt.pw.edu.pl/content/download/2849/17297/file/Z98-art_21.pdf"], "title": "The possibilities of fuel economy - the hybrid traction propulsion", "doi": "", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 2014, "outCitations": [], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/16bef48173461de2ccb412f643722f223af73cb9", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "16bef48173461de2ccb412f643722f223af73cb9", "authors": [{"name": "Spyridon Karytsas", "ids": ["97967297"]}, {"name": "Helen Theodoropoulou", "ids": ["2450293"]}], "journalName": "", "paperAbstract": "Public awareness of renewable energy sources can offer multiple benefits, as it can contribute to the social acceptance of projects based on these energy sources and to the overall improvement of consumers' energy behaviour.

On a test stand which can change attitude, the demonstrator was assembled, the attitude was changed through \u00b11G, and the performance of the demonstrator was measured. As a result of experimenting in \u00b11G, when it operated normally in every case, as did separation of gas and liquid at the level of each subsystem, it turned out satisfactorily and many useful things were learned. It was concluded that it would probably operate satisfactorily in micro-gravity. The Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer and the fuel cell which were used for the experiment comprised the regenerative fuel cell for the experiment, and used a single cell for this research at normal temperature. The phenomenon of ignition delay was improved by improving the injector structure, and adjusting the injection timing in the catalyst ignition experiment of hydrogen/oxygen thruster. It turns out that water adheres to the catalyst layer surface after the end of combustion. The Water-Energy-Cycle Space Propulsion System (WECSPS) combines a Water-Energy-Cycle System and a Propulsion System, and provides the three functions of life support system, energy storage and power generation, and propulsion for attitude and orbit control. In principle it can be used for manned space systems in near-Earth space and near the Moon. The concept is shown in Figure 1. The Water-Energy-Cycle Space Propulsion System (WECSPS) stores hydrogen and oxygen produced by electrolyzing water with electric power generated by photovoltaic panels. At times of shadowing etc, the hydrogen and oxygen which were stored are used for power generation by fuel cells, or are used as propellant. The quantity of hydrogen/oxygen to be stored can be decided freely. For this reason, it could be used for power generation for the 15-day night at a lunar base, not only for orbital spacecraft. In addition, it is highly efficient by using hydrogen/oxygen as propellants, and non-toxic to humans. In this case, it is necessary to carry separately the water to be consumed as propellant. When used as a propulsion system, the WECSPS turns into propulsion supply system. Such a multifunctional space system could become lightweight through combining functions.

Some optimization methods, such as model compression, weight quantization, adaptive window segmentation, are applied to make the deep network faster and less power. Therefore, it can be easily deployed on smart-phones and other embedded devices due to its moderate energy consumption and low latency.

The goal for Cal Poly \u2013 San Luis Obispo's EcoMarathon vehicle for the 2015 competition is to analyze the unique operating mode that the powertrain undergoes during competition and improve their current package to increase fuel efficiency. In this study, fuel delivery, ignition timing and engine temperature are experimentally varied to observe trends in steady state fuel consumption. A developmental simulation is then implemented with these trends to analyze potential differences in transient and steady state tuning targets.

The mean output of ICE in this operational mode is about 15 - 20 % of its installed power. The result is that most of the time the internal combustion engine works in regimes that are far from optimum mode. It means that specific fuel consumption is high. Some examples of measured operational regimes of locomotives in shunting operation and other motive power units are given in the paper. Kinetic energy of a classic diesel locomotive as well as the DMUs and trains is transformed into thermal energy during braking process. Normally it is not possible to utilize this kinetic energy in a reasonable way. In order to improve fuel economy, the kinetic energy of train should be transformed into a suitable form and stored for subsequent use. The improvement can be achieved by using of the unconventional traction drive of rail vehicles. One of possible ways is using of the hybrid traction drive. The hybrid drive includes the ICE, generator, traction motors and the energy storage device. In this case the output of ICE can be substantially lower than in the classic traction. The parameters of such traction drive must be based on analysis of real operational regimes of vehicles.

The analysis results show that PAPF with traditional load current detection methods is effective for parallel resonance damping, but can not damp series resonance when capacitor current is not included in the detecting current. And when capacitor current is included in the detecting current, PAPF is prone to be unstable and can not damp parallel and series resonance. Then a novel control method of PAPF is proposed. PAPF with the proposed control method has excellent performance in damping of both parallel resonance and series resonance, whether the capacitor current is included in the detecting current of PAPF or not.

According to the harmonics distribution caused by power converters, a universal recursive SHC module is developed to deal with a featured group of power harmonics. The proposed optimal SHC (OSHC) is of hybrid structure: All recursive SHC modules with weighted gains are connected in parallel. It bridges the real \u201cnk \u00b1m order RC\u201d and the complex \u201cparallel structure RC\u201d.

The analysis and synthesis of the OSHC system are addressed. The proposed SHC offers power converters a tailor-made optimal control solution for compensating selected harmonic frequencies.

A number of scenarios have been set up, including sensitivity on CO2 and oil prices, inclusion/exclusion of electric drive vehicles, and change in investment possibilities in flexible power plants. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are shown to be competitive in all scenarios except the low oil scenarios. The increased electricity consumption for the electric vehicles is covered by wind power in Denmark and Norway and by coal production in Finland and Germany. The competition between wind power and coal is dependent on fuel price and CO2 price assumptions. Furthermore, introducing the flexibility of electric drive vehicles helps decrease cycling on the remaining power plants. Finally, the electric drive vehicles can replace the use of both heat storage and electric boilers as well as decrease the use of gas turbines.", "inCitations": ["96413d0b1fcbdeca470614ddee3cadf934ca94e7", "e94076ce723a934f42bbf1e138cdd524880a8f1e", "46fec89aca8812a059b1be3a4610e6afd6e4e07b", "d1fc09e6f6a1ea58a6a38cef2627ab7fcf46e5b8", "5bf2b29ea42bd85b4be30f06d657d1a1921db958", "db68d2e1ef29fa1e4023694475c4feabc39b8318", "91b6a54800b4bde2b8f99a0d830c0a06d5a09505", "87dbabff3cd87cf7f9f5726853249bcca0115cf3", "a104aba3488e534df4f4b74a1914e6feedd35381", "9938bc6501bcfaacf77930f32f026703f94eebeb", "9a0ae284c2cb57a22278dedecfe3f995de1b8a69", "6aaecbf23bfb01eba8ad0a4dd98c1f12e28969df", "c0b520b165b50e15dc9ddc307bcfb16dbc9796c9", "1053e9290a15f403b72242470970e2506c76c934", "9efcc95528f30e0503767ab26590a996cd384401", "e995b2de5c1a991a41234cfd4162fab76b539d05", "5d44ae2c15be8782fd6fdb11848a4f28aa242b34", "34aea162c414815e9eaea06f227d70491c6df2a3", "4ab452f15454087df02a04480dfd1d1dd82446ab", "1f86b021e102d864b5e7ed473efeac99bca9fa99", "09d4b4514f5db5c158cd00a91ae590e9c08ffcb2", "21eb8561331fb969d155326d313a5e1c61d7ec12", "9401517f12689ab8753486a0d4c4993503282720", "5cc7265ff28634f13916a4f8badfdc95b1ff94e1", "2f38d8c99e50af863f8fc491ffb9a2d3b4d714ef", "c3e122a78404e018853cfc63f8e53e99665fbeba", "7db02c11ffa4facd44c315bf40417a923c52ec04", "bf8ed20037f60a0b0c1e42ac9e64260b5b7d0109", "b4b6f35fc36764ae314e49679f8d479ad5b52dbe"], "pdfUrls": ["http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/road-transport-and-power-system-scenarios-for-northern-europe-in-2030(70faf526-ff48-4138-932a-24a8625c97a8).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=standard", "http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/road-transport-and-power-system-scenarios-for-northern-europe-in-2030(70faf526-ff48-4138-932a-24a8625c97a8).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=harvard", "http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/road-transport-and-power-system-scenarios-for-northern-europe-in-2030(70faf526-ff48-4138-932a-24a8625c97a8).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=cbe", "http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/road-transport-and-power-system-scenarios-for-northern-europe-in-2030(70faf526-ff48-4138-932a-24a8625c97a8).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=vancouver", "http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/road-transport-and-power-system-scenarios-for-northern-europe-in-2030(70faf526-ff48-4138-932a-24a8625c97a8).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=short", "http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/road-transport-and-power-system-scenarios-for-northern-europe-in-2030(70faf526-ff48-4138-932a-24a8625c97a8).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=apa", "http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/9987260/Road_Transport_and_Power_System_1_.pdf", "http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/road-transport-and-power-system-scenarios-for-northern-europe-in-2030(70faf526-ff48-4138-932a-24a8625c97a8).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=author", "http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/road-transport-and-power-system-scenarios-for-northern-europe-in-2030(70faf526-ff48-4138-932a-24a8625c97a8).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=mla", "http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/road-transport-and-power-system-scenarios-for-northern-europe-in-2030(70faf526-ff48-4138-932a-24a8625c97a8).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=long"], "title": "Road transport and power system scenarios for Northern Europe in 2030", "doi": "10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.11.074", "sources": [], "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.11.074", "venue": "", "subclass": "Y02T"}, {"entities": [], "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "year": 2012, "outCitations": [], "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/13740c11641b4e85aeaf726165bc9ea609649a88", "s2PdfUrl": "", "id": "13740c11641b4e85aeaf726165bc9ea609649a88", "authors": [{"name": "Sven Maertens", "ids": ["96505925"]}], "journalName": "", "paperAbstract": "Against the background of fundamental changes in the air transport sector in the last years (deregulation, emergence of Low Cost Carriers and alliances, rising fuel prices, new ODs from and to emerging markets...), we look at inefficiencies that still occur in the sector, be it on airline, airport, ATC and regulatory level.

The HVDC system is mainly composed by voltage source converters (VSC-HVDC). So, there are four adjustable variables to control the power system characteristics. In this regards, one of these variables can be used as a supplementary controller input, in order to damp the oscillations efficiently. In this work the Singular Value Decomposition\u00a0(SVD) method is used to realize the most effective control input of VSC-HVDC, with the aim of low frequency oscillation damping. Besides, optimum values for supplementary controller gains, are found using imperialist competition algorithm. To confirm strength of the proposed controller, the designed controller is tested in wide range of operating condition and compared with conventional scheme.

Research and development on the selection of suitable containment materials and major components have been underway for several years, and a number of important milestones have been attained. A \"gettered\" refractory alloy test loop, designed to simulate expected corrosion conditions in the power conversion portion of a space power plant, has recently successfully completed 5000 hr of operation at a boiler-outlet temperature of 2000\u00b0F. Evaluation of the loop after the 5000hr test revealed insignificant amounts of corrosion. Results of a heat-transfer research program have conclusively demonstrated the feasibility of the once-through boiling process for potassium. In addition, the data have provided a set of correlations that enables the designer to predict accurately the performance of these once-through boilers. Technology for the inherently reliable electromagnetic pump has been advanced to the point where it is competitive in flight systems and where flight prototypes are under construction. A 5000-hr test has been completed on a fall-size, potassium two-stage turbine without significant malfunction of either the turbine or test facility. At the conclusion of the test, little or no deterioration could be detected in any of the turbine parts.

The future 20 years is the strategic opportunity period of the transition of the transportation energy and powertrain system for China. The greatest characteristics of hydrogen economy lie in its diversity of the primary energy source, the unification of energy carrier and the greening of energy transformation. Development of hydrogen energy transportation powertrain system is suitable for China from the views of the situation of Chinese resources and energy sources, the urban and rural layouts, the superiority of later development and the successful practices of clean cars and electric vehicle development projects. The transition of the transportation energy powertrain system includes three parts: the transition of the energy structure, the transition of the powertrain system and the transition of the fuel infrastructure. The technical pathways of energy powertrain system transition includes expending the use of gaseous fuel to prompt the multiform of the transportation energy and to prepare for the transition of the infrastructure simultaneously, developing and promoting the hybrid technology to solve the current energy and environment problems and to prepare for the transition of powertrain system, and focusing on the research and development and demonstration of fuel cell vehicles and the hydrogen energy technology to prompt the earlier formation of the market of fuel cell vehicles. The goal in the near and medium term of transition is to reduce the fuel consumption by 100 million ton in 2020 by substituting and saving, and the long-term goal is to setup the infrastructure of hydrogen and fuel cell vehicle as the main one replacing the petroleum internal combustion engine vehicle.
